When it comes to solving problems, what is the endgoal here? Is it the endgoal? Or, is it the means to something else? Getting a job at a good company.

When looking at new problems online, resist the urge to solve them right away. Instead, focus more on where the question is coming from. Are there more questions there? Do you have an in-depth understanding of the topic? If not, spend time on it.

Try to go with topic in geeks for geeks instead of picking problems from all over the place and many websites at random.

staircase problem - make it generic. any combination of steps that can be taken to get to the top.

Write your own logic for MooshakCatchingCheese.java

Codility classes.

Implement the logic for the problems specified in the "preparation" folder.

Understand how CustomHashCreatorUtil.java is working.

List of things that we need to be able to do without looking up on the internet:
	* Put some values in a HashMap and loop through the key value pairs.
	* Use java 8 collections more effectively.
	
Practise:
1. Write a small Java application that uses the String class to input one word at a time and
outputs a complete sentence when a terminating punctuation mark is entered.
2. Write an application similar to the one in exercise 1, but output the words in the sentence in
reverse order.
3. Write the same application using a single StringBuffer object passed to the input
method to collect the words in the sentence.
4. Write a class MutableInteger similar to the Java core class Integer but with the
capability to change the value of the integer. (The Integer class, like the String class, is
immutable after it is initialized.)
