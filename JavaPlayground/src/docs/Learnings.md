When trying to solve problems, I realized that my understanding of basic concepts is not that great.
So reading textboooks like Skiena, Sedgewick, etc. is helpful with that.

While reading the textbooks, I realized that my understanding of datastructures (other than arrays) is not that great.
So reading textbooks that help with that is very helpful.
