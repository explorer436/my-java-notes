List of things to consider when looking to learn a new programming language : 

This will give an overview of the practicality of the language.

1. Implement Binary tree search or any other algorithm in the language
1. Implement a RESTful service (producer) and a client for a REST API. There are many open REST services that are available for public consumption.
1. Implement a soap service producer and a soap service client (preferably, using vanilla approach). If it is absolutely necessary to use libraries, be mindful of the impacts of using the libraries. e.g. springboot for java, strongsoap for node.js, etc.
1. Implement parallel service calls (both RESTful and Soap service calls)
1. Verify concurrency
1. Implement a few database operations - RDBMS and NoSQL.

Look into the following :

1. SmallTalk programming language.
1. Web services (soap and rest services) using Haskell.
1. How hard it easy is it to write a web service produce (soap and rest) using vanilla java?
