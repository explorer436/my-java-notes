List of things to consider when looking to learn a new programming language : 

This will give an overview of the practicality of the language.

1. Implement Binary tree search or any other algorithm in the language
1. Implement a RESTful service (producer) and a client for a REST API. There are many open REST services that are available for public consumption.
1. Implement a soap service producer and a soap service client.
1. Implement parallel service calls (both RESTful and Soap service calls)
1. Verify concurrency
1. Implement a few database operations - RDBMS and NoSQL.

Look into the following :

1. SmallTalk programming language.
1. Web services (soap and rest services) using Haskell.
