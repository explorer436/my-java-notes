Count full nodes in a Binary tree (Iterative and Recursive)

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given A binary Tree, how do you count all the full nodes (Nodes which have both children as not NULL) without using recursion and with recursion? Note leaves should not be touched as they have both children as NULL.

        6
       / \
      3    2
     /    / \
    5     7  4
     \
      9

Nodes 2 and 6 are full nodes has both childâ€™s. So count of full nodes in the above tree is 2
