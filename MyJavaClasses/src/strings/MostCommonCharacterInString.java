/**
 * 
	Problem Statement for StringDup
	
	Create a class called StringDup. Given a string made up of ONLY letters and
	digits, determine which character is repeated the most in the string ('A' is
	different than 'a'). If there is a tie, the character which appears first in
	the string (from left to right) should be returned.
	
	Examples :
	
	aaiicccnn = c
	aabbccdd = a
	ab2sbf2dj2skl = 2
	
	Here is the method signature :
	
	public char getMax(String input);
	
	We will check to make sure that the input contains only letters and digits (no
	punctuation marks or spaces).
	
	 
	Definition
	    	
	Class:	StringDup
	Method:	getMax
	Parameters:	String
	Returns:	char
	Method signature:	char getMax(String param0)
	(be sure your method is public)
