* Compare the performace of this method in Haskell with the performance of the java method.
If necessary, modify both of them to write the results to a file directly.

Reimplementing old problems in a more Haskell-y way
We used tail-recursion to solve all the problems of the previous chapter to completely unlearn our muscle-memory of writing for loops and changing values of variables (called “mutation” in the FP world). Now, we’ll solve them again using a more real-world Haskell approach:

(Note: In all the exercises given below, the indicative functions are only the higher-order functions. You are free to use other utiliity functions like mod, toUpper, digitToInt, etc. as required by the solution)
