* Run the program to output the name of the directories on the console.

* Compare the performace of this method in Haskell with the performance of the java method.
If necessary, modify both of them to write the results to a file directly.

- backtracking a tree starting from the nodes
- working with linked lists
- suffix tree like data structures - what do they mean?

Write a program to retrieve the highest or lowest element from a list. When there are duplicate elements, write separate functions to retrieve the one from the left and the one from the left.
