-- Lets take a look at the $ function, also called function application. 
-- Let's check out how it's defined:

-- ($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b  
-- f $ x = f x  

-- What the heck? What is this useless operator? 
-- It's just function application! 
-- Well, almost, but not quite! 
-- Whereas normal function application 
--     (putting a space between two things) has a really high precedence, 
--     the $ function has the lowest precedence. 
-- Function application with a space is left-associative (so f a b c is the same as ((f a) b) c)), 
--     function application with $ is right-associative.

-- That's all very well, but how does this help us? 
-- Most of the time, it's a convenience function so that we don't have to write so many parentheses. 
-- Consider the expression sum (map sqrt [1..130]). 
-- Because $ has such a low precedence, 
--     we can rewrite that expression as sum $ map sqrt [1..130], 
--     saving ourselves precious keystrokes! 
-- When a $ is encountered, 
--     the expression on its right is applied as the parameter to the function on its left. 
-- How about sqrt 3 + 4 + 9? This adds together 9, 4 and the square root of 3. 
-- If we want get the square root of 3 + 4 + 9, 
--     we'd have to write sqrt (3 + 4 + 9) 
--     or if we use $ we can write it as sqrt $ 3 + 4 + 9 
--     because $ has the lowest precedence of any operator. 
-- That's why you can imagine a $ being sort of the equivalent of 
--     writing an opening parentheses 
--     and then writing a closing one on the far right side of the expression.

-- How about sum (filter (> 10) (map (*2) [2..10]))?
-- Well, because $ is right-associative,
--     f (g (z x)) is equal to f $ g $ z x. 
-- And so, we can rewrite sum (filter (> 10) (map (*2) [2..10])) as sum $ filter (> 10) $ map (*2) [2..10].

-- But apart from getting rid of parentheses,
--     $ means that function application can be treated just like another function. 
-- That way, we can, for instance, map function application over a list of functions.
