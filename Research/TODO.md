When it comes to solving problems, what is the endgoal here? 
The endgoal is to get to a point where I can think of a problem in my mind and be able to easily translate it into a solution on paper and implement it using a language (Java or Haskell). And then expand upon the problems. Plus, it is fun to solve puzzles.

When looking at new problems online, resist the urge to solve them right away. Instead, focus more on where the question is coming from. Are there more questions there? Do you have an in-depth understanding of the topic? If not, spend time on it. 
After getting a deeper understanding of the concept, see step below.
Whenever you read about an algorithm or computer science concept, implementing a solution for it either in Java or in Haskell or any of your favorite languages will help remember it in the future.

Write detailed description about handling hashmap collisions in your own words. Get a good understanding of it.

staircase problem - make it generic. any combination of steps that can be taken to get to the top.

Write your own logic for MooshakCatchingCheese.java

Codility classes.

Implement the logic for the problems specified in the "preparation" folder.

Understand how CustomHashCreatorUtil.java is working.

List of things that we need to be able to do without looking up on the internet:
	* Put some values in a HashMap and loop through the key value pairs.
	* Use java 8 collections more effectively.
	
Practise:
1. Write a small Java application that uses the String class to input one word at a time and
outputs a complete sentence when a terminating punctuation mark is entered.
2. Write an application similar to the one in exercise 1, but output the words in the sentence in
reverse order.
3. Write the same application using a single StringBuffer object passed to the input
method to collect the words in the sentence.
4. Write a class MutableInteger similar to the Java core class Integer but with the
capability to change the value of the integer. (The Integer class, like the String class, is
immutable after it is initialized.)

POC ideas:

AWS Lambda - Employee database - DynamoDB in local docker
Employee lambda integration wit MongoDB or a NoSQL database. Don't care too much about the language in which it is implemented - although it would be nice to do it using java.
Writing a web service using Haskell - soap service, soap client, rest service, rest client
SpringRestTemplate example - implement and save it in the repo.
CollectibleFutures - read about it.
REST api starting with Open API spec document
