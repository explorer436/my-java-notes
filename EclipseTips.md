Toggle full screen : `Alt + F11`

In some Eclipse packages, like STS or Eclipse for JEE Developers, the Terminal is already installed in your IDE. 
If not, you can install the TM Terminal from the Eclipse */release update site, as you can see in the image below.
To open the command prompt (shell or terminal) using the path of a project directory inside Eclipse, you just need to select the folder, and press `Ctrl+Alt+T`, or right-click and select Show In Local Terminal > Terminal.


Use CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-T to choose which type of Terminal to run.
