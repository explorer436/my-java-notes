Prepend sudo if logged in as not-privileged user, ie. sudo vim

Press 'i' to get in insert mode and add this to the file:

#+begin_src 
export JAVA_HOME="path that you found"
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
#+end_src

logout and login again, reboot, or use source /etc/profile to apply changes immediately in your current shell
